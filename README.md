# C-Embedded


 Parking sensor project. It is an arduino project which has registry programing. I used C Embedded programing.
The ultrasonic sensor transmits waves, which are converted to electrical impulse. Based on the electrical impulse
I made a 4 digit printer and a PWM signal for led, buzzer. When the sensor measure is high(200 cm) the led will slowly pulse,
when the sensor measure is low(10 cm) the led light is slightly interrupted. The buzzer works same as the led.
